                    <p class="section-text">HopOn&trade; is a shared transit platform designed to make long-distance travel more affordable, transparent, and efficient by allowing drivers to publish planned journeys and riders to join them along the same route.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">Unlike on-demand ride-hailing services, HopOn focuses on scheduled, destination-based travel. Drivers define public pickup and drop-off points, available seating, luggage capacity, and pricing in advance, while riders discover and book trips that already align with their travel plans. The experience is optimized for intercity routes commonly used by tourists and locals, such as Colombo to southern coastal towns or major regional hubs.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">The product was intentionally designed to scale beyond private cars, supporting vans, minibuses, and even public transport operators within the same system.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-label">CONTEXT</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">In mid 2019, Sri Lanka was experiencing a strong tourism surge, with increasing demand for intercity travel. While platforms like Uber and PickMe addressed short, on-demand trips effectively, they were poorly suited for longer, planned journeys. Travelers either had to rent entire vehicles at high cost or rely on rigid public transport options with limited comfort and visibility.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">HopOn&trade; was conceived to bridge this gap by treating travel as a published plan rather than an instant request. The system enables drivers who are already traveling long distances to share unused capacity, reducing individual travel costs, while riders gain access to flexible, affordable options without committing to full vehicle hires. </p>
                    <p class="section-text">Special emphasis was placed on trust, safety, and clarity through public pickup points, identity verification, transparent pricing, and structured communication - making shared travel feel predictable and socially acceptable. The project progressed through full UX design and early development but was ultimately paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which fundamentally changed travel behavior and safety expectations around shared rides.</p>

                    <h3 class="case-study-heading">Introduction</h3>
                    <p>HopOn&trade; is a shared transit platform designed to make long-distance travel in Sri Lanka more affordable, transparent, and efficient. Instead of hailing a ride on demand, drivers publish planned journeys with predefined routes, available seats, and pricing - and riders discover and book trips that already align with where they need to go.</p>
                    <p>The concept was simple but underserved: most vehicles traveling between cities carry empty seats. A bus heading from Colombo to Galle has unused capacity. A van running daily to Arugam Bay leaves with rows unfilled. HopOn was designed to capture that wasted capacity and turn it into shared, affordable, point-to-point travel.</p>
                    <p>This was not a ride-hailing app. It was a journey marketplace - optimized for scheduled, destination-based travel rather than instant, location-based pickup. Drivers set routes, times, and conditions in advance. Riders browsed, compared, and booked. The entire model was built around predictability over immediacy.</p>
                    <p>I led product vision, end-to-end UX design, and early business modeling for HopOn from 2020 through early 2021. The project progressed through full UX design and prototyping but was ultimately shelved when COVID-19 fundamentally changed travel behavior and safety expectations around shared rides.</p>

                    <h3 class="case-study-heading">My Role</h3>
                    <p>I owned the product vision and experience design end-to-end - from initial concept through to high-fidelity prototypes and developer handoff. This wasn't a client project with predefined requirements. I shaped the product strategy, defined the user flows, and designed the interaction model from scratch.</p>
                    <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
                    <ul class="case-study-list">
                        <li><strong>Product vision and system thinking</strong> - defining what HopOn should be, how it should work, and what it should not try to do</li>
                        <li><strong>End-to-end UX flows</strong> - driver journey publishing, rider discovery and booking, pricing logic, route management, and trust/safety frameworks</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction design and screen flows</strong> - high-fidelity screens in Sketch, interactive prototypes in Principle, and flow diagrams in Whimsical</li>
                        <li><strong>Early business and monetization modeling</strong> - pricing formulas, driver economics, commission structures, and MVP scoping</li>
                        <li><strong>Prototyping and handoff</strong> - detailed specifications for the development team to build from</li>

                    <p>In early 2020, Sri Lanka was experiencing strong tourism growth. Intercity travel demand was rising, but options were polarized: either expensive private vehicle hires or rigid public transport with limited comfort and visibility.</p>
                    <p>On-demand ride-hailing platforms had established themselves in urban areas - short trips within cities worked well. But these platforms were fundamentally designed for instant, point-to-point urban rides. They were not built for planned, multi-stop, long-distance journeys where a driver might travel from Colombo through Galle to Katharagama to Arugam Bay over 8 hours.</p>
                    <p>The result was a fragmented landscape: tourists overpaid for private hires, locals squeezed onto overcrowded public buses, and thousands of seats in private and commercial vehicles traveled empty every day between cities.</p>

                    <p>Before committing to design and development, we conducted both qualitative and quantitative research with selected members of the public - intercity travelers, daily commuters, tourists, and vehicle owners. We wanted to validate not just whether people would use a shared journey platform, but how they felt about the specific mechanics: pre-booking seats with strangers, paying online only, sharing ride details with known contacts, and trusting driver-published schedules.</p>
                    <p>We also presented graphical interface prototypes to participants and compared their reactions against their current experiences with local ride-hailing and public transport. The findings were decisive:</p>

                    <p>When we showed prototype interfaces side by side with the existing ride-hailing experience, participants consistently preferred the journey marketplace model - the ability to browse options, see driver profiles, read ratings, compare pricing, and pre-book rather than request and wait. The prototype's transparency resolved the trust concerns that the statistics had surfaced.</p>
                    <p>Qualitative interviews reinforced a critical finding: people did not want another taxi app. They wanted something closer to a flight or bus booking experience - browse available journeys, compare options, and commit with confidence. This shaped every design decision that followed.</p>

The driver's home screen is a map of Sri Lanka centered on their home base, with their earnings balance prominently displayed and an "You're online" status indicator. Below the map, an "Earn more" section surfaces gamified challenges ("12 Trip in a Day Challenge - 2/12 completed") and seasonal demand alerts to drive engagement. Upcoming trips are listed with schedule details covering both outbound and inbound legs. From here, publishing a new trip is one tap away.</p>

                    <p>The rider experience was designed around browsing and comparison - more like searching for flights than hailing a cab. Before accessing the marketplace, first-time riders are presented with the platform's community rules: this is not a taxi or typical ride-hailing service (meet the driver at the given pickup point, sit in any seat), respect others (you're pooling with people, minimize phone calls), no cash (all payments happen online, drivers get paid after the trip), and show up on time (it's like catching a train or bus). These rules set expectations and filter for committed users.</p>
                    <p>The rider's home menu provides access to My Places (saved locations), Inbox, Your Trips, Payments, Free Rides (referral program), a "Drive with us, Earn extra" cross-promotion for the driver app, Carbon Offsetting, and Settings. From the home screen, riders set their origin and destination on a full map view, and the system shows available journeys sorted by departure time, price, comfort level, and driver rating.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Supply Strategy: Fill One Vehicle First</h4>
                    <p>A critical product decision was the "fill one first" algorithm. When multiple vehicles were available on the same route, the system would prioritize filling one vehicle to capacity before surfacing the next one to riders.</p>
                    <p>This approach had several benefits:</p>
                    <ul class="case-study-list">
                        <li><strong>Better driver economics:</strong> A fully booked van earns significantly more per trip than two half-empty vans. Concentrating demand improved driver satisfaction and retention</li>
                        <li><strong>Better rider experience:</strong> Fuller vehicles meant more social proof and a livelier travel experience. An empty van with one passenger felt awkward; a van with seven felt like shared transport</li>
                        <li><strong>Simpler operations:</strong> Fewer active vehicles per route meant fewer coordination challenges, fewer no-shows to manage, and easier real-time tracking</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The MVP deliberately prioritized larger vehicles - buses, vans, and minibuses - over private cars. More seats per vehicle meant faster fill rates, better driver economics, and a more sustainable model. Private car-sharing was planned for a future phase once the marketplace had critical mass.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Public Pickup Points, Not GPS Pins</h4>
                    <p>Instead of letting drivers and riders negotiate exact locations via GPS pins, we designed the system around predefined public pickup points - recognizable locations like Laksala in Colombo, Thumulla Junction, the Galle bus terminal, or major highway rest stops.</p>
                    <p>This solved multiple problems simultaneously: riders knew exactly where to go without GPS confusion, drivers had consistent stopping points that didn't add detour time, and the fixed locations provided natural safety through public visibility. Every booking directed riders to a known, public, well-trafficked location.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Comfort and Add-On Transparency</h4>
                    <p>We designed a layered system that separated permanent vehicle facilities from per-trip amenities. During vehicle setup, drivers toggle persistent facilities - surfboard friendly, extra recline seats, air conditioning, wheelchair friendly, and pet friendly. When scheduling a specific trip, drivers confirm which of these are active for that journey, plus set luggage capacity and seating availability. This distinction let drivers with air conditioning offer it on some routes but not others (e.g., short coastal trips where windows-down was preferred).</p>
                    <p>On the rider side, these appeared as clear badges on journey cards (No Pets, No Smoking, Medium Baggage Ok, Extra Recline Seats) and as paid add-on options during booking - Extra Luggage (from Rs. 130 per person) and Food and Drinks (from Rs. 250), with tiered baggage upgrades (Large at Rs. 125, X Large at Rs. 390). This created a transparent upsell model where riders paid only for what they needed, and drivers earned more from value-added services without raising base fares.</p>

                    <p>The swipe-to-accept model was not available to all riders from day one. It was a trust privilege. When a rider books a seat, the driver receives a notification card showing the passenger's pickup point, destination, profile, preferences, and any notes. During the rider's first few trips on the platform, the driver is required to manually review the rider's profile - their bio, language preferences, conversation style, and previous ratings - before approving them to join the journey. This initial friction was intentional: it protected both parties while the system gathered enough data to build trust.</p>
                    <p>Once a rider completed enough trips and earned positive ratings, they graduated to a "trusted rider" status. At this point, the driver experience simplified to a swipe gesture - right-swipe to confirm, left-swipe to decline. No forms, no menus, no workflow hunting. The trust score was a built-in point mechanism where both drivers and riders rated each other after every trip, and the accumulated score determined how much friction the system applied.</p>
                    <p>New drivers were eased in with shorter journeys first - the system initially suggested routes within a 2-3 hour radius of home before opening up longer distances. This built confidence before committing drivers to 8-hour trips.</p>

                    <p>Sri Lankan intercity travel is rarely on time. Road conditions, weather, and traffic create unpredictable delays. Rather than pretending arrivals would be exact, we designed the system to calculate approximate vehicle location and update estimated arrival at each remaining stop in real time.</p>
                    <p>Riders waiting at intermediate stops could see whether their vehicle was on schedule, 20 minutes late, or stuck in traffic near Bentota. This transparency turned unpredictable waiting into informed waiting - a significant experience improvement.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Comfort Rating System</h4>
                    <p>Beyond star ratings, we designed a multi-dimensional comfort scoring system. After each journey, riders rate specific dimensions: vehicle cleanliness, driver behavior, punctuality, luggage handling, and add-on accuracy (did the AC actually work?). These scores feed into a composite comfort level visible on future journey listings. The search results displayed driver ratings alongside trips driven count (e.g., 5.0 with 12 Driven, or 4.8 with 83 Driven) - giving riders both quality and experience signals at a glance. New drivers without enough ratings received a \"New Driver\" badge rather than an empty star rating, avoiding the cold-start penalty that discourages new supply.</p>
                    <p>This gave riders granular decision-making power and gave drivers clear, actionable feedback on what to improve - not just \"3.5 stars\" but \"your punctuality is excellent, your vehicle cleanliness needs work.\"</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Online-Only Payments</h4>
                    <p>An early and deliberate decision was to remove cash entirely from the platform. No cash exchanges, no card swipes at pickup, no disputes about change. All payments happened online through cards saved in the app. This was not just a convenience choice - it was a safety and accountability decision.</p>
                    <p>Cash creates friction and risk in shared travel: arguments about exact amounts, drivers carrying float, riders claiming they already paid, and no audit trail for disputes. By making the platform cashless from day one, every transaction was traceable, every fare was agreed before boarding, and every payment could be reversed if something went wrong.</p>

                    <p>The 24-hour settlement window was inspired by platforms like Airbnb. If a driver experienced property damage during a trip - a spilled drink on upholstery, a scratched interior panel, or luggage damage - they could raise a dispute within that window. A HopOn staff member would review the claim, determine the appropriate compensation amount, and manually authorize the charge to the rider's saved payment method. The rider was notified of the charge with the reasoning, and funds were released to the driver's original payout method. This dispute model gave drivers confidence that they were protected without requiring upfront damage deposits that would scare away riders.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Know Who You Are Traveling With</h4>
                    <p>Once a driver confirms a booking, both the rider and the driver can see who else is on the trip. Before the journey starts, riders can view the profiles of their co-travelers - their name, profile photo, gender, language preferences, conversation style (prefers quiet, enjoys small talk, or loves interesting conversations), and their trust rating on the platform.</p>
                    <p>This visibility was designed for two reasons. First, safety: knowing who you are sharing a multi-hour journey with, especially on less-traveled routes, reduces anxiety. Second, comfort matching: a rider who speaks only Sinhala can see if their co-travelers and driver speak the same language. A rider who hates phone conversations in enclosed spaces can see if others share that preference. A solo female traveler can see the gender mix of the vehicle before boarding.</p>
                    <p>My Trips showed co-rider counts (e.g., "You and 7 others booked") and after confirmation, the full list of travelers with their profiles and preferences became visible - turning an anonymous shared vehicle into a transparent, predictable social experience.</p>

                    <p>The 45% cut for late cancellations was calibrated carefully. Too low and drivers suffer income loss from no-shows that can't be refilled. Too high and riders feel trapped. The 45% mark compensated drivers enough to partially cover the empty seat while leaving riders willing to cancel honestly rather than simply not showing up - a worse outcome for everyone.</p>

                    <h3 class="case-study-heading">What We Learned</h3>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Supply-side experience is the entire product</h4>
                    <p>In a two-sided marketplace for travel, the driver experience determines everything. If publishing a journey is hard, drivers won't do it. If economics aren't transparent, drivers won't trust it. If the app interrupts their driving routine, drivers will abandon it. We learned that 80% of our design effort needed to go toward making the driver's life easier - even though riders are the paying customers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Predefined routes beat on-demand dispatch for long-distance</h4>
                    <p>The biggest conceptual breakthrough was rejecting the on-demand model entirely. Long-distance travel is inherently planned. Drivers know where they are going days in advance. Riders plan trips hours or days ahead. Matching planned supply with planned demand is fundamentally better than dispatching drivers reactively - and the UX reflected this with a discovery and booking model rather than a request and wait model.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Trust requires physical design, not just digital features</h4>
                    <p>Adding ID verification badges and star ratings was necessary but not sufficient. Real trust for shared long-distance travel came from physical design decisions: public pickup points that were well-lit and visible, routes that followed main highways (not backroads), and departure times that kept travel within daylight hours by default. Trust was built through the structure of the experience, not just the interface.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Timing matters more than product quality</h4>
                    <p>COVID-19 ended this project - not because the product was wrong, but because the world changed. Shared enclosed spaces with strangers went from a compelling value proposition to a public health concern overnight. We had a strong product concept, validated user needs, and working prototypes. None of that mattered when the fundamental behavior we were designing for became socially unacceptable. The lesson is humbling: external timing can override every design decision you make.</p>

                <div class="case-study-closing">
                    <p>HopOn was shelved but never abandoned. The intercity travel problem in Sri Lanka hasn't been solved. Empty seats still travel between cities daily. Tourists still overpay for private hires. Locals still cramp into overcrowded buses. The concept of a journey marketplace - where drivers publish and riders discover - remains valid and, I believe, inevitable.</p>
                    <p>This project taught me more about marketplace design, supply-side thinking, and the intersection of physical and digital trust than any client engagement could. It was a product built from genuine conviction that travel should be shared, affordable, and transparent - and the design work reflects that belief at every level.</p>
