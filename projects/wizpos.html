                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h3 class="case-study-heading">Introduction</h3>
                    <p>WizPOS&trade; is a cloud-based point-of-sale system built by eWiz Solutions in Sri Lanka, with the end goal of entering the United States retail market - supermarkets, wholesale clubs, and high-volume chain operations where speed and reliability are non-negotiable.</p>
                    <p>While the product was developed in Colombo, our ambition extended far beyond the local market. The system needed to work equally well for a Sri Lankan supermarket cashier processing LKR transactions and an American wholesale operator running USD tenders across multiple lanes. Two very different retail cultures, one product.</p>
                    <p>I joined the project when the core system was functionally complete - backend logic, React frontend, and POS workflows were in place. What was missing was the human layer: POS ergonomics, visual coherence, touch optimization, and the kind of usability polish that separates a functional tool from a market-ready product.</p>
                    <p>I worked as a UX Engineer on this project - designing the experience in Sketch, prototyping interactions in Principle, and then building the production frontend myself in HTML and CSS. I integrated the UI directly with a React developer, closing the gap between design intent and shipped product.</p>
                    <p>WizPOS was designed as a touch-first system from day one. The primary interface runs entirely on touchscreen terminals with no physical keyboard dependency. That said, during our research phase we interviewed and observed both traditional keyboard-based POS operators and touch-based system users to understand the full spectrum of operator habits, muscle memory, and expectations before committing to our touch-only direction.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- My Role -->
                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h3 class="case-study-heading">My Role</h3>
                    <p>I worked on this project as a UX Engineer, not just a designer. That meant I owned the full pipeline: research, design in Sketch, interactive prototyping in Principle, and building the production frontend in HTML and CSS. I then worked directly with a React developer to integrate my frontend code into the React component architecture.</p>
                    <p>This design-to-code ownership meant fewer handover gaps. What I designed is what got built, because I built it. When a touch target needed to be 2px larger or a transition needed to feel faster, I adjusted it in code, not in a spec document.</p>
                    <p>I collaborated closely with:</p>
                    <ul class="case-study-list">
                        <li><strong>eWiz Solutions (Sri Lanka)</strong> - product owners who drove the engineering and market vision</li>
                        <li><strong>React Developer</strong> - worked alongside me to integrate my HTML/CSS frontend into the React component system, handling state management and backend connections while I owned the UI layer</li>
                        <li><strong>Retail Operators</strong> - cashiers, shift managers, and store owners observed and interviewed in live retail environments across Sri Lanka</li>
                        <li><strong>US Market Advisors</strong> - retail consultants who provided insights into American POS conventions, compliance, and operator expectations</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- Research Section - NEW -->
                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h3 class="case-study-heading">Research & Discovery</h3>
                    <p>Before drawing a single screen, we invested significant time understanding how POS operators actually work - not how product specs say they should work. Our research approach combined existing industry data with hands-on fieldwork.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Leveraging Existing Research</h4>
                    <p>We didn't start from zero. We studied published research on retail POS operator diversity and literacy levels across the US and South Asian markets. Key findings we built upon:</p>
                    <ul class="case-study-list">
                        <li><strong>Operator demographics:</strong> US retail employs a wide range of ages and tech literacy levels - from teens in their first job to senior staff with decades of register experience. Sri Lanka's retail workforce skews younger but with lower touchscreen familiarity outside of smartphones</li>
                        <li><strong>Literacy & language:</strong> US operators include non-native English speakers. Sri Lankan operators may work in Sinhala, Tamil, or English. The UI needed to communicate through visual hierarchy and spatial consistency, not just text</li>
                        <li><strong>Fingertip & touch ergonomics:</strong> We referenced ISO touch-target research and anthropometric data on fingertip sizes across populations. Average adult fingertip pad width is 10-14mm, but effective touch targets need to account for angle of approach, screen position, and fatigue. We settled on 18mm minimum targets with 4mm spacing - exceeding Apple's HIG recommendation of 44pt</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Field Observations: Sri Lankan Retail Market</h4>
                    <p>We spent weeks observing cashiers in live retail environments across Colombo and suburbs - large-scale supermarket chains, mid-size grocery stores, and small independent shops using random POS setups.</p>
                </div>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <p>What we observed in the field:</p>
                    <ul class="case-study-list">
                        <li><strong>Speed under pressure:</strong> Experienced Sri Lankan supermarket cashiers process 20-30 items per minute during peak. Their hands move in a rhythm - scan, bag, scan, bag. Any interface interruption that breaks this rhythm creates visible frustration and queue buildup</li>
                        <li><strong>Finger behavior:</strong> Operators use index fingers for most taps, but switch to thumbs on smaller screens. Angle of approach changes throughout a shift - early morning taps are precise; end-of-shift taps drift toward screen edges. Touch targets need to forgive this degradation</li>
                        <li><strong>Workarounds are data:</strong> Cashiers at one major Sri Lankan supermarket chain had developed unofficial shortcuts - sticky notes with item codes, handwritten price lists taped to monitors, cheat sheets for discount workflows. These workarounds told us exactly where the existing UI was failing</li>
                        <li><strong>Drawer culture:</strong> Unlike US operations where the drawer opens only at tender, Sri Lankan retail involves frequent cash handling - mid-shift reconciliations, cash drops, change-making for non-purchase transactions. The POS needed to support these as first-class workflows, not buried settings</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-role operators:</strong> In smaller Sri Lankan shops, one person is cashier, inventory manager, and store owner. The interface needed role-fluid access, not rigid permission hierarchies</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        <p class="constraint-callout-text">In Sri Lanka, only banks are authorized to run card payment terminals. These are bulky dumb terminals - completely separate devices with no integration capability. Every card transaction forces the operator to physically shift focus away from the POS screen to a disconnected banking terminal, process the payment in isolation, then return to the POS to confirm. This fragmented flow breaks the transaction rhythm, increases checkout time, and prevents us from offering the sleek integrated card reader experience that US POS systems take for granted. We had to design our payment workflow to gracefully accommodate this forced context switch rather than fight against it.</p>

                    <p>We conducted structured interviews with 15+ cashiers and shift supervisors working in large-scale Sri Lankan retail chains - the closest analog to the US market we were targeting. These were operators processing hundreds of transactions daily on existing POS systems.</p>

                    <p>One of the most critical and often overlooked aspects of POS design is the physical interaction. A POS terminal isn't a phone or tablet - it's operated for 8-hour shifts, at specific angles, with varying hand sizes and fatigue levels. We treated touch ergonomics as a core design constraint, not an afterthought.</p>

                        <p class="research-finding-desc">Adult fingertip pad widths range from 10mm to 14mm across demographics. Sri Lankan female operators trend toward the smaller end; American male wholesale staff trend toward the larger end. A single touch-target size must accommodate this full range.</p>

                            <p class="research-finding-text">We standardized on 18mm minimum touch targets (exceeding both Apple HIG 44pt and Material Design 48dp guidelines) with 4mm inter-element spacing. For primary action buttons (Tender, Void, Refund), we went larger - 24mm targets - to reduce mis-taps on high-stakes actions.</p>

                        <p class="research-finding-desc">Through observation, we tracked how operator tapping behavior changes across a shift. Early in the day, taps are centered and precise. By hour 6-8, taps drift toward screen edges, become less precise, and operators unconsciously decrease tap pressure.</p>

                            <p class="research-finding-text">We designed hit zones slightly larger than the visible button boundaries (invisible touch padding). Primary actions were placed in the screen's natural "comfort zone" - center-right for right-handed operators - with less-critical options pushed to edges.</p>

                            <p class="research-finding-text">We mapped comfortable reach zones for common terminal positions and placed high-frequency actions within the "effortless reach" area.

These are bulky dumb terminals running as completely separate devices - the operator must switch focus away from the POS to a disconnected banking terminal for every card transaction. This prevented us from using an integrated card reader and forced us to design around an inherently fragmented payment flow.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">The Strategy: Configurable Workflows, Not Feature Flags</h4>
                    <p>Rather than building separate versions for each market, we designed the core POS with <strong>workflow configuration</strong> at its center. Regional partners could customize transaction flows, menu layouts, drawer behaviors, and shortcut mappings while sharing a common codebase.</p>
                    <p>This approach meant designing interactions that were <strong>flexible yet consistent</strong> - a Sri Lankan operator's drawer settlement flow and an American operator's quick-tender flow had to feel like the same product, even though they served different needs.</p>

                    <p>For the highest-frequency tasks - item scanning, tendering, discounts, voids - I prototyped multiple interaction patterns and speed-tested them with actual operators. We measured taps-to-completion, time-on-task, and error rates for each approach.</p>
                    <p>Every millisecond of decision time matters in retail. A POS that takes 2 seconds longer per transaction costs a busy cashier 30+ minutes of wasted time per shift.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Sketches & Early Exploration</h4>
                    <p>I explored multiple layout directions through rapid sketching - challenging assumptions about where action buttons should live, how item lists should scroll, and whether the traditional "left-list, right-actions" POS layout was actually optimal. The answer, based on research: it depends on the operator's handedness and screen angle.</p>

                    <p>Rather than displaying all 20+ options at once, the transaction interface shows only the most common actions for the current context. Scanning items? You see quantity, discount, void. Ready to pay? You see tender methods. Processing a return? You see refund options.</p>
                    <p>The main screen stays clean: <strong>Tender, Refund, Discount, Void, Suspend, Customer.</strong> Everything else is one contextual tap away - no nested menus, no hunting.</p>

                    <p>Instead of "Error 0x4E," the POS speaks operator language. Payment declined? <em>"Card was declined. Try again, use a different card, or switch to cash."</em> Barcode not found? <em>"Item not recognized. Enter SKU manually, search by name, or scan again."</em></p>
                    <p>Every error state becomes a guided decision tree - not a dead end. Operators always know what happened and what to do next.</p>

                    <p>One interface across 7" mobile carts, 10" tablets, and 15" terminals. Layouts adapt intelligently - not just scaling, but restructuring. On smaller screens, secondary actions collapse into swipe gestures. On larger screens, inventory and reporting panels appear alongside the transaction view.</p>
                    <p>Touch targets remain 18mm minimum on every screen size. Primary actions stay in the comfort zone regardless of terminal angle or mounting position.</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Offline-First Architecture</h4>
                    <p>The POS works fully offline - transactions process locally, receipts print, drawers open. When connectivity returns, data syncs automatically with conflict resolution. No more "Internet is down, we can't ring sales." No more handwritten receipts during outages.</p>
                    <p>This was non-negotiable for Sri Lankan retail outside Colombo metro and equally critical for US wholesale floors with connectivity dead zones.</p>

                    <p>Sri Lankan retail partners confirmed the system handled their complex cash-management workflows without friction.

                    <p>After successfully building and validating the system, we handed over WizPOS to the respective product owners at eWiz Solutions for continued development and improvement. The design system documentation, component libraries, workflow configuration guides, and frontend codebase were structured for long-term maintainability so their team could evolve the product independently from that point forward.</p>

                    <h3 class="case-study-heading">What We Learned</h3>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Watch hands, not faces</h4>
                    <p>The most valuable research data came from watching operators' hands - where they hesitated, where they mis-tapped, where their rhythm broke. Interviews told us what operators thought they did. Observation showed us what they actually did. The two rarely matched.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Design for the 7th hour, not the 1st</h4>
                    <p>A POS interface that works perfectly for a rested operator in the morning means nothing if it falls apart during the fatigue and pressure of hour 7. We learned to test at the end of shifts, not the beginning. That's when the real usability problems reveal themselves.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Colombo stress-tests better than any lab</h4>
                    <p>If a POS system survives the chaos of Sri Lankan retail - inconsistent power, unreliable internet, diverse hardware, operators handling cash and conversation simultaneously - it's ready for any market. Our Sri Lankan validation phase caught issues that controlled lab testing would have completely missed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-block">
                    <h4 class="case-study-subheading">Configurability is a design decision, not a dev decision</h4>
                    <p>The choice to make workflows configurable rather than hard-coded wasn't just an engineering architecture decision - it was a UX decision. It meant designing interaction patterns that remained coherent regardless of which modules were active. That's harder than designing one fixed experience, but infinitely more scalable.</p>

                <div class="case-study-closing">
                    <p>WizPOS taught me that POS design is physical design. It's not just screens and flows - it's fingertips, fatigue, and the unforgiving pressure of a customer waiting. Getting the human layer right means faster transactions, less training, and real economic impact for every retail partner who adopts the system.</p>
